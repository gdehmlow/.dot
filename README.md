.dot
============

All my dotfiles / terminal setup for OS X in one place. First install XCode, [iTerm](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home) and [zprezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) if you don't already have them, then just copy the following into the terminal:

    cd ~
    git clone git@github.com:gdehmlow/.dot.git
    .dot/setup.sh

The script creates symlinks for the dotfiles, downloads the iTerm2 theme, and also installs Homebrew and RVM.

For adroll:

Install flowdock, bettertouchtool, sublimetext
